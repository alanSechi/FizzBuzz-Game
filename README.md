# FizzBuzz-Game

 **With this repo I wanted to put into practice the for loop of javascript.**

### PROBLEM:
1. Print the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive, each on their own line. 

2. If, however, the number is a multiple of three then print Fizz instead, and if the number is a multiple of five then print Buzz. 

3. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five then print FizzBuzz.

### SOLUTION
1. First of all, i've defined the variables and the constants 

2. Second,I've defined the button click event, which shows the list of numbers with their label (fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz) 

3. Third, I added some CSS to style it
